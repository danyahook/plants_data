As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. It is a cool to warm-growing orchid with average temperatures between 12-25°C. Provide bright light (avoiding direct mid-day sun) and higher humidity by misting regularly in spring and summer, then move the plant to a bright but cooler place in autumn and winter. Reduce watering and feeding until warmer temperatures initiate new growth in spring. See indoor orchid cultivation",
