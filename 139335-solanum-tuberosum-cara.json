Draw earth up around the stems as they emerge, to exclude light and prevent the potatoes from becoming green. Water well in dry periods although this variety does show a reasonable tolerance to drought. Potatoes can also be grown in large containers or potato gro-bags. See potato cultivation for further advice.",
