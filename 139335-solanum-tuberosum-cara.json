This variety can get quite tall so a sheltered spot would be ideal. Improve soil by adding organic matter, such as well-rotted manure, in the autumn. Draw earth up around the stems as they emerge, to exclude light and prevent the potatoes from becoming green. Water well in dry periods although this variety does show a reasonable tolerance to drought. Potatoes can also be grown in large containers or potato gro-bags. See potato cultivation for further advice.",
