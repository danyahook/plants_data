Do not overpot, these plants often perform better with slightly restricted roots. Maintain temperatures between 7°C and 24°C. Water thoroughly in the growing season, preferably with rainwater, allowing compost to almost dry between waterings. Feed in spring, using a half-strength liquid solution in two feeds a few weeks apart. Red tinting on the leaves in winter may be a sign of cold, move the plant to a warmer place.",
