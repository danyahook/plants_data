Do not overpot, these plants often perform better with slightly restricted roots. Maintain temperatures between 7\u00b0C and 24\u00b0C. Water thoroughly in the growing season, preferably with rainwater, allowing compost to almost dry between waterings. Feed in spring, using a half-strength liquid solution in two feeds a few weeks apart. Red tinting on the leaves in winter may be a sign of cold, move the plant to a warmer place.",
