In cool regions, lift the plants in autumn, before the first frosts and store the crowns in trays of just moist compost in frost-free conditions until spring. In areas where temperatures fall no lower than -5˚C (23˚F) in winter, plants may be left in the ground and protected by a thick mulch over winter, carefully removing this in spring, after the risk of frosts has passed.",
        "propagation": "Propagate by basal softwood cuttings from overwintered stools in late winter or early spring. Cuttings should be rooted in a loamless compost the surface of which is covered with dry sand and kept in a temperature of 16°C. Place in a cold frame after first rooting and protect from frost. Harden off in mid spring. Established clumps may be propagated by division in spring.",
