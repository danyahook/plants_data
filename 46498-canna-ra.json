They are also suitable for well-watered borders or conservatories where potted plants can be stood in deep saucers of water. Before autumn frosts, bring plants from outdoors into a frost-free greenhouse or conservatory. Keep the pots moist but not saturated. In April, increase temperatures and plant the sprouted plants out in late May when the risk of frost has passed",
