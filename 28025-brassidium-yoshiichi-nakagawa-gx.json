        "cultivation": "Grow in an open bark-based orchid compost with addition of perlite, sphagnum moss or coir. Provide enough bright filtered light, but keep away from direct sunlight or a heating source. Ideal temperatures are around 15°C minimum at night and up to maximum 25 °C during day. Water regularly, when the pot feels light when lifted. Ensure that all water drains away, preventing the plant sitting wet. Orchid fertiliser can be applied regularly throughout the growing season. Reduce watering and feeding in winter months. The orchid will naturally produce aerial roots, growing outside of the pot. As with many orchids, they grow best when well-established and slightly pot-bound. Re-potting should be only done if the plant overgrows its container or before the potting mix starts to deteriorate - approximately once in 2-3 years.",
        "propagation": "Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows its container. Each division should have at least 3 older pseudobulbs with a sufficient amount of stored energy and water, to support new growth and reduce stress after repotting.",
        "suggested_planting_locations_and_garden_types": [

        "pruning": "No pruning required. Remove the flowering stem once finished flowering.",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to mealybugs, aphids and scale insects.",
        "diseases": "Generally disease-free."
