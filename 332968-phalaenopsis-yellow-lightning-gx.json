Provide bright filtered light, good ventilation and, from spring to autumn, mist daily for high humidity. Water freely as compost dries out, allowing water to drain and apply an orchid fertiliser monthly. Provide a minimum day temperature of 17\u00b0C and night minimum of 15\u00b0C. See phalaenopsis cultivation",
        "propagation": "Small plantlets (keiki) may appear from the nodes on the flower stems. Detach plantlets when they have developed several good roots and pot them up in orchid compost. Water sparingly at first, but mist them daily",
