When in growth water moderately and apply a nitrogen rich fertiliser monthly. Keep just moist in winter. Plants benefit from regular misting and from being stood on a pebble tray, particularly in a warm dry atmosphere. Their main requirement is an even temperature, in winter not below 13°C and without the sharp fluctuations found in so many houses. Avoid draughty situations and keep them away from heater fumes",
