        "cultivation": "Plants are best grown mounted on cork bark or wood if sufficient humidity can be provided. Alternatively, grow in a pot in an epiphytic, medium grade, bark-based potting mix with added perlite, moss, or coir. It is best to stake each cane to keep the upright form when potted. If grown in a basket or mounted, the plant will naturally develop pendulous form. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide large amount of bright, but indirect light and 80 - 85% humidity in spring and summer, then move the plant to a bright, cooler room in autumn and winter. Reduce watering and feeding until warmer temperatures initiate new growth in spring. See indoor orchid cultivation",
