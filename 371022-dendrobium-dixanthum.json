        "cultivation": "Plants are best grown mounted on cork bark or wood if sufficient humidity can be provided. Alternatively, grow in a pot in an epiphytic, medium grade, bark-based potting mix with added perlite, moss, or coir. It is best to stake each cane to keep the upright form when potted. If grown in a basket or mounted, the plant will naturally develop pendulous form. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide large amount of bright, but indirect light and 80 - 85% humidity in spring and summer, then move the plant to a bright, cooler room in autumn and winter. Reduce watering and feeding until warmer temperatures initiate new growth in spring. See indoor orchid cultivation",
        "propagation": "Propagation by seed is only possible in controlled laboratory environment. Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows the pot. Sideshoots (keiki) may develop on older canes - remove and pot them into sphagnum moss when the new roots are at least 2cm long.",
        "suggested_planting_locations_and_garden_types": [
            "Conservatory and greenhouse"
        ],
        "pruning": "No pruning required. Remove spent flowers as necessary, but do not cut the whole cane unless completely shrivelled. Oldest canes may be removed as long as there are enough, younger, thick, leaf-bearing canes on the plant.",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to scale insects, aphids, mealybugs and red spider mite.",
        "diseases": "Generally disease-free."
