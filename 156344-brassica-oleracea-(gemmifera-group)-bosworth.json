        "cultivation": "Sow seed thinly, about 1-2cm deep and in rows 15cm apart, with shelter from for example cloches or a coldframe, in late winter, or directly outdoors in a seedbed in early spring; thin seedlings to at least 3cm apart, and when they are 10-15 cm high, in early summer, transplant young plants to growing positions, 60cm apart, in fertile, moist but well-drained soil, preferably neutral or alkaline and medium or heavy, in a sunny site sheltered from the wind; harvest sprouts from autumn onwards; for more advice, see Brussels sprouts cultivation",
        "propagation": "Propagate by seed sown under cover in early spring; if plants are allowed to flower and seed, the seedlings will not come true because 'Bosworth' is an F1 hybrid",
        "pruning": "No pruning required",
        "pests": "Brussels sprouts, like other brassicas, may be affected by many pests, including cabbage root fly, caterpillars of small and large white butterflies, aphids, flea beetles, slugs and snails, and by birds, especially pigeons",
        "diseases": "Brussels sprouts, like other brassicas, may be affected by many diseases, including club root, especially in acidic soil; 'Bosworth' is said to have some resistance to downy mildew and ringspot"
