Feed every 10-14 days. See advice on cultivating tomatoes for more detail",

        "pruning": "Pinch out the growing tip when the plant has reached the desired height, either reaching the top of the greenhouse or support, or when the plant has set seven trusses indoors or four trusses outdoors. Regularly remove all side shoots",
