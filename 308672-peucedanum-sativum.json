Add well-rotted manure the previous autumn, especially if growing on a clay or chalk soil. Chalk and clay aren’t ideal for growing parsnips so you could also try deep containers. The ideal soil pH is 6.5-7 so adjust pH where necessary. See parsnip cultivation for more information.",
        "propagation": "Propagate by seed from March until May. Seeds are renowned for poor germination so it is best to avoid sowing during cold, wet conditions to improve your chance of success. Parsnips are a biennial plant but are grown by gardeners as an annual.",
