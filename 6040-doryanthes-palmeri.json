In frost-free areas, grow in humus-rich, well-drained soil in sun, with plenty of water in the growing season, but keep dry in winter as mature plants may withstand several degrees of frost if kept dry",
        "propagation": "Propagate by seed sown at 10-13\u00b0C in spring, by division of mature bulbils, which are occasionally produced on flower stems, or by division, removing suckers which are produced after flowering",
