Place in a cool place indoors and after flowering gradually acclimatise to outdoor conditions before planting out in the garden. Thrives in neutral to alkaline soils that are moist, fertile and humus-rich. Partial shade is ideal but can tolerate full sun if the soil is not prone to drying out. Provide shelter from strong, cold winds. Mulch annually in autumn. For further details see hellebore cultivation",
