Grow in moist but well-drained potting compost, in bright filtered light with good ventilation. When in growth apply a liquid balanced fertiliser monthly. Keep just moist over winter. See tender fuchsia cultivation for more detailed advice, fertile soil in sun or light shade in a sheltered position. Plant the base of the stem 5cm below the soil surface. In cold areas, provide a deep winter mulch and shelter from cold drying winds. See tender fuchsia cultivation",
