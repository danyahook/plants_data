As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide dappled shade and higher humidity in spring and summer, then move the plant to a bright, but cool room in autumn and winter. Cool growing Dendrobiums require longer period of winter rest. Reduce watering and feeding until warmer temperatures initiate flowering and new growth in spring. Average temperatures are 16-24°C in summer and 10-16°C during winter.
