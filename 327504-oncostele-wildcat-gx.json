Provide enough bright filtered light, but keep away from direct sunlight or a heating source. Ideal temperatures are around minimum 13°C at night and up to maximum 25 °C during day. Water regularly, when the pot feels light when lifted. Ensure that all water drains away, preventing the plant sitting wet. Orchid fertiliser can be applied regularly throughout the growing season. Reduce watering and feeding in winter months. For more notes on cultivation, see Oncidium orchids (warm section).",
        "propagation": "Propagation by seed is only possible in a controlled laboratory environment. Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows its container. Each division should have at least 3 older pseudobulbs with a suffient amount of stored energy and water, to support new growth and reduce stress after repotting.",
