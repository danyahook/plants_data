Plants are best grown in pot with fresh sphagnum moss, or mounted if sufficient humidity can be provided. Moss should be replaced regularly - every, or every other spring when the new growth starts. Humidity of over 80% and excellent air movement are essential. To grow well, plant requires a temperature of 10-15°C between day and night. This species has exceptionally long-lasting flowers that can last up to one year if grown in optimal environment. See indoor orchid cultivation",
