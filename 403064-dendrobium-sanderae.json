Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide bright light conditions throughout the year. The average temperatures are 22-25\u00b0C during day and 13-16\u00b0C at night time. Plant requires frequent watering and relatively high humidity during spring and summer months and a slightly drier conditions in winter - reduce watering and feeding in October, but do not leave plant dry for long period of time. See indoor orchid cultivation",
        "propagation": "Propagation by seed is only possible in controlled laboratory environment. Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows the pot. Sideshoots (keiki) may develop on older canes - remove and pot them into sphagnum moss when the new roots are at least 2cm long.",
        "suggested_planting_locations_and_garden_types": [
            "Conservatory and greenhouse"

        "pruning": "No pruning required. Remove spent flowers as necessary, but do not cut the whole cane unless completely shrivelled. Oldest canes may be removed as long as there are enough, younger, thick, leaf-bearing canes on the plant.",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to scale insects, aphids, mealybugs and red spider mite.",
        "diseases": "Generally disease-free."
