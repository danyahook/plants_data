Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide bright light conditions throughout the year. The average temperatures are 22-25°C during day and 13-16°C at night time. Plant requires frequent watering and relatively high humidity during spring and summer months and a slightly drier conditions in winter - reduce watering and feeding in October, but do not leave plant dry for long period of time.
