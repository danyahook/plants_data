        "cultivation": "Grow in a sheltered site in full sun in fertile well-drained soil, enriched with organic matter and general purpose fertiliser. Water freely in dry weather. Pinching out the growing tip when the plants are 15-20cm tall to encourage free flowering bushy plants. Staking is usually required. There is no need to deadhead. In mild areas leave in the ground protected by a thick mulch. Elsewhere lift the crowns and store in a greenhouse, raising fresh plants from these each year",

        "pruning": "Cut back to near ground level in the autumn, before lifting and storing for the winter",
        "pests": "Aphids and leaf miners are common pests. Leaf and bud eelworms can damage stock that has not been heat-treated. Earwigs sometimes damage blooms. Capsid bug and glasshouse red spider mite are occasional pests",
        "diseases": "Chrysanthemum white rust, can be very damaging and hard to control. Powdery mildews can be damaging in dry conditions. In wet weather grey moulds and other fungal rots can be severe. A virus may cause stunting and leaf markings"
