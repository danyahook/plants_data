        "cultivation": "Grow in a sunny, sheltered spot in soil that has been enriched with well-rotted organic matter. Sweetcorn can tolerate many soil types but prefers well-drained soils with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. As this is a \u2018Supersweet\u2019 type, avoid growing next to other varieties to prevent cross pollination if you want the cobs to retain their sweet taste. 'Supersweet' varieties can also be more temperamental so the seeds need to be sown at the correct time, at the correct depth and in the correct temperature - check the packet for more information. Harvest from August to October. See sweetcorn cultivation for futher information.",
        "propagation": "Sow seeds undercover from mid-spring in pots or modules and then plant out May - June after hardening off and the last frosts have passed. Alternatively sow 'in situ' from late spring to early summer. Always plant in a grid pattern to ensure pollination.",
        "pruning": "No pruning required.",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to damage from birds, slugs, mice and badgers.",
        "diseases": "May be susceptible to smuts which appear as large galls on the cobs and stalks in hot weather."
