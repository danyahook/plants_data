        "pruning": "Train fan-trained trees in spring. Prune established fans and carry out routine pruning on established cherry trees when harvesting the fruits in summer. See pruning acid cherries",
        "pests": "Protect trees from birds that can damage buds and eat fruit. May suffer from cherry blackfly and other aphids, leaf-mining moths, pear and cherry slugworm, winter moth and other caterpillars. Spotted wing drosophila, a fruit fly, is likely to become an increasing problem",
