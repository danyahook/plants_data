        "cultivation": "Grow in a sheltered site in full sun in fertile well-drained soil, enriched with organic matter and general purpose fertiliser. Water freely in dry weather. Pinching out the growing tip when the plants are 15-20cm tall to encourage free flowering bushy plants. Staking is usually required. There is no need to deadhead. In mild areas leave in the ground protected by a thick mulch. Elsewhere lift the crowns and store in a greenhouse, raising fresh plants from these each year",
