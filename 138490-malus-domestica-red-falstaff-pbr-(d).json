        "propagation": "Propagate by grafting in midwinter or by chip budding in late summer on clonal rootstock for fruit. The rootstock will largely determine the vigour of the tree. Fruit grown from pips will not resemble the parent",

        "diseases": "Average resistance to common apple diseases: apple canker, apple scab, and powdery mildews. Apples are also susceptible to brown rot, honey fungus and blossom wilt"
