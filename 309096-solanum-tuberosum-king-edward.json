Improve soil by adding organic matter, such as well-rotted manure, in the autumn. Draw earth up around the stems as they emerge, to exclude light and prevent the potatoes from becoming green. Water well in dry periods. Potatoes can also be grown in large containers or potato gro-bags. See potato cultivation for further advice.",

After two to three weeks the shoots will begin to sprout. Plant out after frosts have passed, from about mid March to mid April.",
