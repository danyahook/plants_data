    "how_to_grow": {
        "cultivation": "Plants are best grown mounted on cork bark or wood if grown in conditions where sufficient humidity can be provided during the growing season. Alternatively, grow in a pot or basket, in an epiphytic, medium grade, bark-based potting mix with added perlite, moss, or coir. If mounted or grown in a basket, the plant will develop more pendulous form. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide bright light and high humidity in spring and summer. Minimum winter temperatures are 12\u00b0C and maximum summer temperatures are 22-24\u00b0C. Plant grows best with an amplitude of 8\u00b0C between day and night time. Plant requires a period of rest in winter - reduce watering and feeding in autumn, until warmer temperatures initiate new growth in spring. See indoor orchid cultivation",
        "propagation": "Propagation by seed is only possible in controlled laboratory environment. Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows the pot. Sideshoots (keiki) may develop on older canes -remove and pot them into sphagnum moss when the new roots are at least 2cm long.",
        "suggested_planting_locations_and_garden_types": [
            "Conservatory and greenhouse"
        ],
        "pruning": "No pruning required. Remove spent flowers as necessary, but do not cut the whole cane unless completely shrivelled - usually after few years of growth. Oldest canes may be removed as long as there are enough younger canes on the plant.",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to scale insects, aphids, mealybugs and red spider mite.",
        "diseases": "Generally disease-free."
