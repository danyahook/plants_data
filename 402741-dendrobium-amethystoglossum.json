        "cultivation": "Plants are best grown mounted on cork bark or wood if grown in conditions where sufficient humidity can be provided during the growing season. Alternatively, grow in a pot or basket, in an epiphytic, medium grade, bark-based potting mix with added perlite, moss, or coir. If mounted or grown in a basket, the plant will develop more pendulous form. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide bright light and high humidity in spring and summer. Minimum winter temperatures are 12°C and maximum summer temperatures are 22-24°C. Plant grows best with an amplitude of 8°C between day and night time. Plant requires a period of rest in winter - reduce watering and feeding in autumn, until warmer temperatures initiate new growth in spring. See indoor orchid cultivation",
