Avoid very dry conditions and exposure to strong winds. Tilia trees are sometimes associated with large numbers of dead bumblebees. Scientific studies have demonstrated that this is not due to toxic nectar or pollen, but may be due to a complex interaction of weather and suboptimal nectar. It does not usually happen every year and tends to coincide with the natural end of bumblebee nests, so is unlikely to cause any larger scale problems",
