The compost should be kept continually moist to wet during the growing season by standing the container in a tray of lime-free water, such as rainwater or Reverse Osmosis water. Keep just moist during the winter and do not stand the plants in water. Do not apply fertiliser at all through the year. Minimum temperatures should be no lower than 10C in the winter. In lower temperatures the plant may die back to the roots, but sometimes regenerates again in the spring.",
