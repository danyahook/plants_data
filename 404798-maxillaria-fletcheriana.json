Requires day temperatures around 18-20\u00b0C and 14-16\u00b0C at night. Provide good light levels, but avoid direct sunlight. Water plants thoroughly when compost is almost dry, allow to drain and use orchid fertiliser regularly during growing season. See also indoor orchid cultivation",
        "propagation": "Propagation by seed is only possible in a controlled laboratory environment. Mature plants may be divided in early or mid spring, when the plant overgrows its container. Each division should have at least 3-4 healthy, older pseudobulbs with a sufficient amount of stored energy and water, to support new growth and reduce stress after repotting",
