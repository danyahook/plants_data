Alternatively, grow in a basket in an epiphytic, medium grade, bark-based potting mix with added perlite, moss, or coir. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Re-pot before the potting mix starts to decompose, ideally in spring when the new growth appears. For best results in cultivation, temperatures should drop at least 10-14°C at night time. Provide indirect light and high humidity by misting regularly in spring and summer. Ensure that roots dry-out between the waterings, especially in winter. See indoor orchid cultivation",
