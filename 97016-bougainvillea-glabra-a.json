Containerised plants can be moved outside for summer. Increase watering from spring as the plants start back into active growth and apply a balanced liquid feed until the bracts show colour, then switch to a high potassium feed. Decrease watering and cease feeding in autumn. Maintain a minimum night temperature of 10°C. See bougainvillea cultivation for further information",
