Pot firmly into epiphytic or terrestrial orchid compost, water thoroughly when compost is almost dry, allow to drain and use orchid fertiliser at every third watering. Water sparingly in winter. Place outside in dappled shade during the summer months to aid flower initiation. This cymbidium hybrid is often grown in a basket because of the pendulous nature of the flower spikes.
