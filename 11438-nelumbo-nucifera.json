As growth proceeds, gradually lower the containers to increase the water depth to 40-60cm (16-24in), or 15-22cm (6-9in) for smaller cultivars. Remove fading foliage. In cold areas, reduce the water level gradually in autumn, remove the container and overwinter in frost-free conditions, keeping the rhizomes just moist. Under glass, grow in large containers in an indoor pool in full light",
        "propagation": "Propagate by seed sown in spring, preferably scarified before sowing, at a minumum temperature of 25°C (77°F) in small containers of loam covered by 5cm (2in) of water. Increase water depth and container size until plants are large enough to plant in the flowering site. Propagate by division of the fragile rhizomes, which resent disturbance. In spring, plant rootstock horizontally just below the soil surface, and barely submerge until growth starts",
