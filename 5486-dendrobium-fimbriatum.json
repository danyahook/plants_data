As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. It is best to stake each cane to keep the upright form when potted. If grown in a basket, the plant will develop more pendulous form. It is a cool to warm-growing orchid with average temperatures between 12-25°C. Provide bright light (avoiding direct mid-day sun) and higher humidity by misting regularly in spring and summer. In autumn, reduce watering and feeding until warmer temperatures initiate flowering and new growth in spring. See indoor orchid cultivation",
