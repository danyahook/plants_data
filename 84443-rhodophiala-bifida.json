        "cultivation": "Pot newly purchased bulbs in autumn, planting so that two-thirds of the bulb remains above the surface and water sparingly at first. Use a loam-based compost (JI No2) with added perlite for extra drainage. Newly emerging leaves will signify that root activity has started, and water can then be applied freely whenever the compost in the pot approaches dryness. A warm buoyant atmosphere with a temperature ideally in the region of 15-18\u00b0C and a sunny position are desirable for good growth. Exposure to the sun under glass should be avoided only in the hottest part of summer",
        "propagation": "Propagate by seed sown as fresh as possible in a temperature of 16-18\u00b0C. Seeds can be started in John Innes seed compost and seedlings potted on using John Innes No 2 with the addition of extra sharp sand or grit. Grow in individual small pots, potting on periodically during the spring-summer season of vigorous growth into slightly larger pots as the young plants develop or each time the pot becomes well filled with roots. Keep plants growing actively, in moderate warmth, allowing no periods of dormancy. Cultivars will not come true from seed; an alternative method of propagation is to remove offsets in autumn",
