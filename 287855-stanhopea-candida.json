        "cultivation": "Grow in a hanging basket lined with moss, in an open, bark-based orchid compost with addition of perlite and sphagnum moss. Provide enough bright filtered light, but keep away from direct sunlight or a heating source. May be grown in intermediate to warm conditions with temperatures between 12-30 °C. Seasonal and daily fluctuation of temperatures encourage flowering. Average humidity of 50-70% is sufficient and watering should be frequent enough during growing season (approximately once per week), with being reduced by half during winter months. Large specimens produce best flowering, however it is desirable to repot plants every few years to avoid stale, disintegrated potting mix.",
        "propagation": "Propagation by seed is only possible in a controlled laboratory environment. Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows its container. Each division should have at least 3 older pseudobulbs with a sufficient amount of stored energy and water, to support new growth and reduce stress after repotting.",

        "pruning": "No pruning required. Remove spent flowers after flowering.",
        "pests": "Generally pest-free, but may be affected by scale insects or mealybugs.",
        "diseases": "Generally disease-free. Insufficient ventilation combined with overhead watering may cause bacterial spots on the leaves."
