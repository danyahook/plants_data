Will grow in partial shade, but the leaves will be most colourful and wood will ripen better in an open, sunny position. Grow in the open in milder areas and in coastal gardens with shelter from the worst cold, drying winds. In colder gardens grow in a sheltered position such as a south- or west-facing wall, and protect roots in winter with a deep dry mulch",
