Water thoroughly when the growing medium is almost dry and allow to drain; allow to dry out between watering during the winter. Fertilise regularly and re-pot after flowering when pot bound using a suitable orchid compost. If possible, put the plant outside in dappled shade after the last frost and bring back in before the frosts start to aid flower initiation. See indoor orchid cultivation",
