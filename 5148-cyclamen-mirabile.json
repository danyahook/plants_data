Plant 2 to 2.5cm deep or with the tops of the tubers just at the soil surface. Site in bright filtered light and provide moderate humidity. Water moderately when in growth but reduce humidity and water as the leaves fade. Keep completely dry when dormant. Apply a low-nitrogen liquid fertiliser every two months when in full leaf.
