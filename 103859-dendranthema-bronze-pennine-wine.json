        "cultivation": "Grow in a sheltered site in full sun in fertile well-drained soil, enriched with organic matter and general purpose fertiliser. Water freely in dry weather. Pinching out the growing tip when the plants are 15-20cm tall to encourage free flowering bushy plants. Staking is usually required. There is no need to deadhead. In mild areas leave in the ground protected by a thick mulch. Elsewhere lift the crowns and store in a greenhouse, raising fresh plants from these each year",

        "pruning": "Cut back to near ground level in the autumn, before lifting and storing for the winter",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to aphids and leaf miners. Leaf and bud eelworms can damage stock that has not been heat-treated; earwigs sometimes damage blooms and capsid bug and glasshouse red spider mite are occasional pests",
        "diseases": "May be susceptible to chrysanthemum white rust which can be very damaging and hard to control. Powdery mildews in dry conditions; grey moulds and other fungal rots can be severe in wet conditions and a virus can cause stunting and leaf markings"
