Grow epiphytically on bark or wood to recreate the natural environment of growing on trees, using an equal mix of coarse leaf mould, loam, and charcoal in bright filtered light and hight humidity. In growth, water freely, mist daily, and feed monthly. Do not allow roots to dry out. Benefits from occasional immersion of the entire root ball in water for several minutes and then drained. Water sparingly in winter. See fern cultivation for further advice",
