Flowering and bract colouring is initiated by short winter day-length, occurring naturally in December and January. So from November onwards, plants should be put in a dark room after twelve hours of daylight and protected from artificial light sources Plants need a constant temperature of around 18\u00b0C (55\u00b0F) to colour up well, so make sure they do not get too cold",
