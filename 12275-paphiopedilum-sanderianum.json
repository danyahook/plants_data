Average summer temperatures are between 20 - 25°C, with winter temperatures falling to 18 - 22°C. Apply fertiliser with every third watering. Avoid heavy misting or overhead watering. As the plant lacks pseudobulbs, it shouldn't be left dry for long time. Water plant as it approaches dryness, but avoid standing in water, or keeping wet for prolonged period. See Paphiopedilum cultivation for more detailed advice.",
