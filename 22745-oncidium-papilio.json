Provide enough bright filtered light, but keep away from direct sunlight or a heating source. Ideal temperatures are around minimum 14°C at night and up to maximum 30 °C during day. Water regularly, when the pot feels light when lifted. Ensure that all water drains away, preventing the plant sitting wet. Orchid fertiliser can be applied regularly throughout the growing season. Reduce watering and feeding in winter months. For more notes on cultivation, see oncidium orchid (warm) cultivation",
