Sweetcorn can tolerate many soil types but prefers well-drained soils with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. As this is a ‘Supersweet’ type, avoid growing next to other varieties to prevent cross pollination if you want the cobs to retain their sweet taste. 'Supersweet' varieties can also be more temperamental so the seeds need to be sown at the correct time, at the correct depth and in the correct temperature - check the packet for more information. Harvest from July to October. See sweetcorn cultivation for futher information.",
