Provide bright, full-sun conditions which are essential for development of flowering stems. Long daylight are also essential, with minimum of 10 hours throughout the year. In the UK, supplemential grow lights might be required to support strong growth development and flowering. Night temperatures shouldn't drop below 15°C, but the plant will tolerate daytime temperatures up to 30-35°C during summer. Water and feed plants often during the growing season. Ensure that all water drains away, preventing the plant sitting in water. Reduce watering to minimum in winter months while dormant and keep in a bright, sunny position. As with many orchids, they grow best when well-established and slightly pot-bound. Re-potting should be only done if the plant overgrows its container or before the potting mix starts to deteriorate - approximately once in 2-3 years. The plant should only be re-potted when the new growth appears in spring. See also indoor orchid cultivation",
