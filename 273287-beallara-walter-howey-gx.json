Provide enough bright filtered light, but keep away from direct sunlight or a heating source. Ideal temperatures are around 12\u00b0C minimum at night and up to maximum 25 \u00b0C during day. Water regularly, when the pot feels light when lifted. Ensure that all water drains away, preventing the plant sitting wet. Orchid fertiliser can be applied regularly throughout the growing season. Reduce watering and feeding in winter months. Allow period of lower temperatures to encourage flowering. For more notes see oncidium orchid (cool) cultivation",
        "propagation": "Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows its container. Each division should have at least 3 older pseudobulbs with a sufficient amount of stored energy and water, to support new growth and reduce stress after repotting.",
