Lift bulbs for winter and keep in a dry, frost free place. Under glass grow in a container of loam-based potting compost (JI No.2) with added leaf mould and grit in bright, filtered light. During the growing season, water freely and apply a general liquid fertiliser every 2-3 weeks. Stand container on a saucer of damp gravel to increase humidity. In the winter months keep compost just lightly moist and temperatures above 10°C.",
