Grow under glass or indoors epiphytically in a mix of 1 part fibrous loam, 1 part coarse sand and 2-3 parts leaf mould with a little charcoal. Filtered light, constant temperature (min 16°C) and high humidity are required in summer, and full light in winter. In the growing season water freely and apply a balanced liquid fertiliser. Can be grown outdoors epiphytically in a warm, moist site or in moist, coarse, humus-rich soil",
