As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide bright light conditions throughout the year. The average temperatures in summer are 25-30°C during day and 16-20°C at night time. Minimum growing temperatures in winter are 10-13°C. Plant requires frequent watering and relatively high humidity during spring and summer months and a slightly drier conditions in winter - reduce watering and feeding in October, but do not leave plant dry for long period of time.
