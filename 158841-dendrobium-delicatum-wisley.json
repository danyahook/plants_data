        "cultivation": "Plants are best grown in a pot in an epiphytic, medium grade, bark-based potting mix with added perlite, moss, or coir. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide dappled shade and higher humidity in spring and summer, then move the plant to a bright, but cool room in autumn and winter. Cool growing plants require longer period of dormancy. Reduce watering and feeding until warmer temperatures initiate flowering and new growth in spring. Average temperatures are 16-24°C in summer and 10-16°C during winter. See indoor orchid cultivation",
        "propagation": "Propagation by seed is only possible in controlled laboratory environment. Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows the pot. Sideshoots (keiki) may develop on older canes -remove and pot them into sphagnum moss when the new roots are at least 2cm long.",
        "suggested_planting_locations_and_garden_types": [
            "Conservatory and greenhouse"
        ],
        "pruning": "No pruning required. Remove spent flowers as necessary, but do not cut the whole cane unless completely shrivelled. Oldest canes may be removed as long as there are at least three, younger, thick, leaf-bearing canes on the plant.",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to scale insects, aphids, mealybugs and red spider mite.",
        "diseases": "Generally disease-free."
