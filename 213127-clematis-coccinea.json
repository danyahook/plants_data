Plant with the crown 5-8cm deep to encourage new shoots to grow from below ground level. Protect crown with a dry winter mulch of straw or wood chips. Can be grown in containers at least 45cm deep and wide in a loam-based potting compost to overwinter in a cold greenhouse or conservatory in cold locations. See clematis cultivation",
