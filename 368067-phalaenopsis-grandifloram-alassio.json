Provide enough bright filtered light, but keep away from direct mid-day sunlight or heating source. Ideal temperatures are around 17\u00b0C at night and 20 - 25 \u00b0C during day. Mist aerial roots regularly and water the plant when almost dry - pale, silvery roots are a good indication when to water. Orchid fertiliser can be applied regularly throughout the season. See Phalaenopsis cultivation for more details",
