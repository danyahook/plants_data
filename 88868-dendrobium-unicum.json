Alternatively, grow in a basket in an epiphytic, medium grade, bark-based potting mix with added perlite, moss, or coir. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide bright light and sufficient humidity by misting regularly throughout the growing season. Reduce watering and feeding during the rest period in winter. For a successfull cultivation, the plant requires good air movement, and a significant drop of temperature between day and night time.
