May be grown outdoors in frost-free areas, or in a conservatory or large container that can be moved indoors in winter. Position in full sun or light shade, and shelter from cold, dry winds. Though this species is not currently widely grown, it is the subject of much research into the production of summer flowering camellias, and has been recorded flowering well into winter in ideal conditions.
