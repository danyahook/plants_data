Grow in an epiphytic, medium grade, bark-based potting mix with added perlite, moss, or coir. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide bright, filtered light throughout the year. The average temperatures are 25-30°C during day and 16-20°C at night time, with an amplitude of 8-10°C between day and night. Plant requires frequent watering and relatively high humidity during summer months and a period of rest in winter - reduce watering and feeding in October, until warmer temperatures initiate flowering and new growth in spring.
