It is best to stake each cane to keep the upright form when potted. If grown in a basket, the plant will develop more pendulous form. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide dappled shade and higher humidity in spring and summer, then move the plant to a bright, but cool room in autumn and winter. Reduce watering and feeding until warmer temperatures initiate flowering and new growth in spring. See indoor orchid cultivation",
