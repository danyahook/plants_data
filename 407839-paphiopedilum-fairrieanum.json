Average summer temperatures are between 20 - 25\u00b0C, with winter temperatures falling to 18 - 22\u00b0C. Apply fertiliser with every third watering. Avoid heavy misting or overhead watering. As the plant lacks pseudobulbs, it shouldn't be left dry for long time. Water plant as it approaches dryness, but avoid standing in water, or keeping wet for prolonged period. See Paphiopedilum cultivation for more detailed advice.",
        "propagation": "Propagation by seed is only possible in a controlled laboratory environment. Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows its container. Each division should have at least 3 healthy, rooted plant rosettes with a suffient amount of stored energy and water, to support new growth and reduce stress after repotting.",

        "pests": "Generally pest-free. May be susceptible to mealybugs.",
        "diseases": "Generally disease-free. Overhead watering in combination with low temperatures may cause bacterial rots in the centre of leaf rosettes."
