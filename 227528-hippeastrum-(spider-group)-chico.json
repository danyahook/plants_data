After flowering reduce watering as the leaves die off; keep dry when dormant. Pot on every 3-5 years in autumn. See hippeastrum cultivation for further information",
        "propagation": "Propagate by removing offsets in autumn. Sow seed as soon as ripe at 16-18°C; keep seedlings growing without a dormant period to encourage earlier flowering",
