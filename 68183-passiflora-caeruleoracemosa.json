Well suited for a conservatory. May be grown outdoors in most fertile, moist but well-drained soils in mild areas. Hardy to about -1\u00b0C, an excellent drainage is essential, but best grown under cover. Provide support for climbing stems and shelter from cold, drying winds",
        "propagation": "Propagate by seed sown at 13 to 18\u00b0C in spring or root semi-hardwood cuttings in summer. Layering can be carried out in spring or autumn",
