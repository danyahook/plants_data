Tree size will vary with rootstock and training method. See apple cultivation for further advice",
        "propagation": "Propagate by grafting in midwinter or chip budding in late summer on a clonal rootstock for fruit. The rootstock will largely determine the vigour of the tree",

        "diseases": "Good resistance to common apple diseases: apple canker, apple scab, powdery mildews and bitter pit. May be susceptible to brown rot, honey fungus and blossom wilt"
