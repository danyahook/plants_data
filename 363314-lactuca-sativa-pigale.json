Lettuces grow best on soil that is close to neutral so if you have very acidic or alkaline soil you may want to consider raised beds, containers or improving the pH of your soil. Water when the soil is dry, ideally early in the morning. Harvest from May until September. See lettuce cultivation for more information.",
