Water moderately throughout the growing season and feed weekly with a balanced liquid fertiliser",

Cuttings should be rooted in a loamless compost the surface of which is covered with dry sand and kept in a temperature of 16°C. Place in a cold frame after first rooting and protect from frost. Harden off in mid spring. Established clumps may be propagated by division in spring.",
