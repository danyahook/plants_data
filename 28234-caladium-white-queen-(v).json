Water sparingly initially and keep the pots warm (about 20\u00b0C) to help them come out of their winter dormancy. Protect from direct sun, which can burn the foliage. In autumn the foliage will begin to die back; suspend watering and remove withered top growth. Either lift and store the tubers or keep them in their pots over winter. Start them back into growth the following spring",
