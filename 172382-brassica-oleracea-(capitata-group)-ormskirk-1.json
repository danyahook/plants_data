It is very popular food for pigeons which only netting can prevent. It is also eaten by snails, although once plants are established, this damage isn't usually severe. The cabbage root fly can cause failure to thrive and a heavy infestation of mealy cabbage aphid can spoil the harvest",
        "diseases": "May be susceptible to brassica downy mildew and brassica white blister. In areas where brassicas have been grown before, clubroot can build up in the soil"
