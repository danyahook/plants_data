Under glass grow in loam-based potting compost with added leaf mould and grit in full light with shade from hot sun. Flowering will be prolonged if light levels are reduced when the buds open. Water freely when in growth and apply a dilute balanced liquid fertiliser monthly. Keep just moist when dormant and do not pot on regularly as flowering is best when congested",
