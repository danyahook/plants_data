To reduce chances of harvesting forked carrots in clay soil choose a short-rooted cultivar. Keep seeds well-watered until your seedlings have emerged. You can also sow seeds in containers, especially if you select a cultivar with a shorter root. Harvest carrots from August through the winter March. For more advice, see carrots cultivation.",
