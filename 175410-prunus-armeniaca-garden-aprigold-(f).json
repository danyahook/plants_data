        "cultivation": "Apricots flourish on deep, moisture-retentive, well-drained, ideally slightly alkaline soils and struggle in poor, shallow soils. Thsi cultivar is well suited for container growing – fruit in containers. If container grown, ideally overwinter under cover such as in a cold greenhouse or place in a very sheltered spot. The early blossom is vulnerable to frost, so trees need a warm, sheltered position. Protect blossom from frost at night, and hand pollinate if insects are scarce. See How to grow: Apricots for cultivation details",
        "propagation": "Propagate by grafting on rootstock for fruit. Seed-raised plants are likely to be inferior to the parent",

        ],
        "pruning": "Naturally compact. It needs minimal pruning. Prune in summer if needed. See How to grow: Apricots for more details",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to aphids, brown scale, glasshouse red spider mite. Birds and squirrels may damage fruit",
        "diseases": "May be susceptible to silver leaf, bacterial canker, blossom wilt and brown rot. Not usually affected by peach leaf curl"
