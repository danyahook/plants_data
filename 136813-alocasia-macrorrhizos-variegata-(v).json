Water freely in the growing season, provide high humidity by placing container on a tray of moist gravel or pebbles and apply a balanced liquid fertiliser every 2-3 weeks. Water moderately in winter. Requires a minimum temperature of 15-18\u00b0C. Can be planted outside after frost, or started off in pots under glass in late winter to early spring. Plant bulbs so their growing tip is just above the soil surface, water sparingly initially then keep moist during the growing season and lift bulbs in autumn before the first frosts; keep tubers dry and frost free throughout winter",
