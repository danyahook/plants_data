Mulching around the plant witll help with moisture retention. Transplant the matured pot-grown plant into the outside ground two weeks after the last frost. Cover the main stem with up to 2 inches of topsoil to promote root development for better support against the wind. Provide 8 hours of full sun for the best flavour. Caging or trellising is recommended to allow the plant to grow vertically which will promote a higher crop yield and give space for a larger number of plants.",
