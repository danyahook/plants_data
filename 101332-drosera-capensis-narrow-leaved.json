        "cultivation": "Under glass grow in a mix of equal parts moss peat or fertiliser-free peat substitute and sand, in full light, although may need shading from hot midday sun in summer. The compost should be kept continually moist to wet during the growing season by standing the container in a tray of lime-free water, such as rainwater or Reverse Osmosis water. Keep just moist during the winter and do not stand the plants in water. Do not apply fertiliser at all through the year. Minimum temperatures should be no lower than 5C in the winter. In consistently lower temperatures the plant produces overwintering buds called hibernacula at the apex of the old stem, whilst the foliage dies back. When the plant dies back to the roots, it often regenerates again in the spring when the temperatures rise.",
        "propagation": "Propagate by seed as soon as ripe. Stored seed rapidly loses viability. Leaf cuttings during the growing season and root cuttings taken when dormant are alternative methods of propagation",
