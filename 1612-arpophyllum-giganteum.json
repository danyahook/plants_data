        "cultivation": "Grow in an open, bark-based orchid compost with addition of perlite and sphagnum moss. Provide enough bright filtered light, but keep away from direct sunlight or a heating source. May be grown in intermediate to warm conditions with temperatures between 12-30 °C. Seasonal and daily fluctuations of temperatures encourage flowering. Average humidity of 50-70% is sufficient and watering should be frequent enough during growing season (approximately once per week), with being reduced by half during winter months. Large specimens produce best flowering, however it is desirable to repot plants every few years to avoid stale, disintegrated potting mix.",
        "propagation": "Propagation by seed is only possible in a controlled laboratory environment. Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows its container. Each division should have at least 3 older growths with a sufficient amount of stored energy and water, to support new growth and reduce stress after repotting.",
        "suggested_planting_locations_and_garden_types": [
            "Conservatory and greenhouse"
        ],
        "pruning": "No pruning required",
        "pests": "Generally pest-free, but may be affected by scale insects or mealybugs.",
        "diseases": "Generally disease-free. Poor air movement may cause bacterial of fungal rots. Good hygiene practice and sterilising cutting tools prevent the spread of virus diseases."
