To reduce chances of harvesting forked carrots in clay soil choose a short-rooted cultivar. Keep seeds well-watered until your seedlings have emerged. You can also sow seeds in containers, especially if you select a cultivar with a shorter root. Harvest carrots from June, right through the winter until January.

Make drills with a hoe, water the base and sow the seed. It is best to sow sparingly so you don’t have to thin the carrots too much later on as this can attract carrot fly. Cover with soil and water in. See grow your own advice pages on how to grow carrots for further advice",
