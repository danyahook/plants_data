        "cultivation": "Plants are best grown mounted on cork bark or wood if sufficient humidity can be provided. Alternatively, grow in a pot in an epiphytic, medium grade, bark-based potting mix with added perlite, moss, or coir. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. It is a warm-growing orchid and the temperatures should not drop below 16°C. It can be grown similarly to Moth Orchid (Phalaenopsis) but requires much brighter conditions. For best results in cultivation, temperatures should drop at least 10°C at night time. Provide indirect light and high humidity by misting regularly in spring and summer, then move the plant to a bright, room in autumn and winter. Ensure that roots dry-out between the waterings, especially in winter. See indoor orchid cultivation",
