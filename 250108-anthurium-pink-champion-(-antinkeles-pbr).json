Grow under glass or indoors epiphytically in a mix of 1 part fibrous loam, 1 part coarse sand and 2-3 parts leaf mould with a little charcoal. Filtered light, constant temperature (min 16\u00b0C) and high humidity are required in summer, and full light in winter. In the growing season water freely and apply a balanced liquid fertiliser. Can be grown outdoors epiphytically in a warm, moist site or in moist, coarse, humus-rich soil",
        "propagation": "Propagate by seed sown at 24-27\u00b0C as soon as ripe; seeds can take months to germinate. Propagate by division in winter. As this plant is protected by Plant Breeders' Rights, any propagation should be for personal rather than commercial use",
