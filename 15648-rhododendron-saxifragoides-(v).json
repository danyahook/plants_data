Position in bright, filtered light, keeping temperatures as consistent as possible, and always above 8°C and below 25°C. Keep moist; in its natural environment this plant grows in boggy conditions. Maintain high levels of humidity but ensure air circulation to minimise fungal problems. See rhododendron cultivation for more detailed advice",
