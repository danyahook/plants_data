Irrigate moderately from spring to summer, and sparingly in winter allowing the compost to dry up between waterings. Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and switch to a high potassium fertilizer when flowering starts. Overwinter in containers before the first frost in autumn. See Pelargonium cultivation for further advice.",
