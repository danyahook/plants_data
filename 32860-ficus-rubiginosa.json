When in growth water moderately and apply a nitrogen rich fertiliser monthly. Keep just moist in winter. Plants benefit from regular misting and from being stood on a pebble tray, particularly in a warm dry atmosphere. Their main requirement is an even temperature, in winter not below 13\u00b0C and without the sharp fluctuations found in so many houses. Avoid draughty situations and keep them away from heater fumes",
