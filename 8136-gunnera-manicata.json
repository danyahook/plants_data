While this does not prevent it from being sold or from being grown in gardens in the Republic of Ireland, the RHS encourages those that do grow it to take great care with managing it and with disposing of unwanted material. The RHS also encourages gardeners in the Republic of Ireland to find alternative plants to grow to those listed on Schedule 3",
