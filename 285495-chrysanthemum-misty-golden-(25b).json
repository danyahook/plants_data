Pinching out the growing tip when the plants are 15-20cm tall encourages free-flowering, bushy plants. Staking is usually required. There is no need to deadhead. In mild areas leave in the ground protected by a thick mulch. Elsewhere lift the crowns and store in a greenhouse, raising fresh plants from these each year. See chrysanthemum cultivation",
