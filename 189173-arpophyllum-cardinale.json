Provide enough bright filtered light, but keep away from direct sunlight or a heating source. May be grown in intermediate to warm conditions with temperatures between 12-30 °C. Seasonal and daily fluctuations of temperatures encourage flowering. Average humidity of 50-70% is sufficient and watering should be frequent enough during growing season (approximately once per week), with being reduced by half during winter months. Large specimens produce best flowering, however it is desirable to repot plants every few years to avoid stale, disintegrated potting mix.",
