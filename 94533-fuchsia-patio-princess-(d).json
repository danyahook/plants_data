Grow in moist but well-drained potting compost, in bright filtered light with good ventilation. When in growth apply a liquid balanced fertiliser monthly. Keep just moist over winter. See tender fuchsia cultivation for more detailed advice in summer, in moist, fertile soil. Use a multipurpose compost for planting into hanging baskets and containers. In very sheltered areas, this fuchsia may overwinter sucessfully in the ground. Plant the base of the stem 5cm below the soil surface and provide a deep winter mulch and shelter from cold drying winds. See tender fuchsia cultivation for further information",
