When the flower spikes reach one third to half their final height, feed with a potassium-rich fertiliser such as a tomato feed. Repeat every 10-14 days until three weeks after flowering. In areas where there is frost, lift the corms when the foliage has turned yellow-brown. Snap the stem off the corms and dry the corms off for 14 days and keep the new corms dry and frost-free until planting time",
