        "pruning": "The main pruning time is early winter (Nov-Dec) but pinching and thinning are needed throughout the growing season. See Grape pruning",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to grapevine blister mite, glasshouse red spider mite, brown scale, woolly vine scale and spotted wing drosophila (fruit fly) and may be susceptible to mealybugs under glass",
