        "cultivation": "Plants are best grown in basket or mounted on cork bark or wood if grown in conditions where sufficient humidity can be provided during the growing season. Grow in an epiphytic, medium grade, bark-based potting mix with added perlite, moss, or coir. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Provide bright, filtered light throughout the year. The average temperatures are 25-30°C during day and 16-20°C at night time, with an amplitude of 8-10°C between day and night. Plant requires frequent watering and relatively high humidity during summer months and a period of rest in winter - reduce watering and feeding in October, until warmer temperatures initiate flowering and new growth in spring.
