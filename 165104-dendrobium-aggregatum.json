        "cultivation": "Plants are best grown mounted on cork bark or wood if sufficient humidity can be provided. Alternatively, grow in a basket in an epiphytic, medium grade, bark-based potting mix with added perlite, moss, or coir. As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. Re-pot before the potting mix starts to decompose, ideally in spring when the new growth appears. For best results in cultivation, temperatures should drop at least 10-14°C at night time. Provide indirect light and high humidity by misting regularly in spring and summer. Ensure that roots dry-out between the waterings, especially in winter. See indoor orchid cultivation",
        "propagation": "Propagation by seed is only possible in controlled laboratory environment. Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows the pot. Sideshoots (keiki) may develop on older canes - remove and pot them into sphagnum moss when the new roots are at least 2cm long.",
        "suggested_planting_locations_and_garden_types": [
            "Conservatory and greenhouse"
        ],
        "pruning": "No pruning required. Remove spent flowers as necessary, but do not cut the whole cane unless completely shrivelled. Oldest canes may be removed as long as there are enough, younger, thick, leaf-bearing canes on the plant.",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to scale insects, aphids, mealybugs and red spider mite.",
        "diseases": "Generally disease-free."
