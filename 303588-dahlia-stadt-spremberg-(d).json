Pinch out growing tips to encourage bushy plants and stake. Water freely in dry periods. Cut down once damaged by frost. Tubers may survive outdoors in mild areas with a good covering of mulch. Otherwise lift and store tubers in autumn to replant, or use as a source of cuttings, in spring. See dahlia cultivation",
