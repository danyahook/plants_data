Pinch out the growing tips when the plants are 15-20cm to encourage bushy, floriferous plants. Staking is usually required. In mild areas the plants can be left in the ground over winter; elsewhere lift the crowns and store in a greenhouse, raising fresh plants from these each year. See staking perennials and chrysanthemum cultivation for further information",
