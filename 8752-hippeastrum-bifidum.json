Use a loam-based compost (JI No2) with added perlite for extra drainage. Newly emerging leaves will signify that root activity has started, and water can then be applied freely whenever the compost in the pot approaches dryness. A warm buoyant atmosphere with a temperature ideally in the region of 15-18°C and a sunny position are desirable for good growth. Exposure to the sun under glass should be avoided only in the hottest part of summer",
