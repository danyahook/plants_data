        "Grow in fertile, moist but well-drained, neutral soil in sun or partial shade. The woody rootstock tends to lift out of the ground so mulch annually or lift and replant",

        "Grow in damp, humus-rich soil, or in up to {}cm of standing water. Ideal at the margins of ponds or streams, in bog gardens, or in spring-flooding areas that dry out over summer. Thrives in high summer temperatures",

        "Performs best with good drainage and sunlight. Effective ground cover plant",

        "Grow in any fertile, moist but well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerant of all but the most extreme conditions",
        "Grow in well-drained soil in full sun or part shade. Suitable for hedging but requires regular trimming. Fast growing and it has the potential to become a nuisance",
        "Grow in fertile soil in partial shade in cool conditions. Sow seed in June/July for an Autumn harvest. May bolt if sown too early in Spring. See RHS GYO advice profile on Endive for further information",
        "Under glass grow in a loam-based potting compost in full light. When in growth water freely and apply a balanced liquid fertiliser monthly. Water sparingly in winter. Can be grown outdoors in warmer climes in most fertile soils",
        "Prefers alkaline to neutral, moist but well-drained soil in full sun, but will tolerate acid soil and dry conditions. Survives well amongst short grass",
        "In containers under glass grow in a loam-based compost such as John Innes No.{} with added grit or sharp sand in full or filtered light. Water moderately when in growth and apply balanced liquid feed monthly. Water sparingly in winter. May be placed outdoors in summer in a sunny sheltered spot",
        "Needs sun to thrive, with moderately fertile, humus-rich, moist but well-drained soil. For best flowering apply a balanced fertiliser and mulch in late winter or early spring and a balanced fertiliser again in early summer. Tolerant of poor soil. See rose cultivation",

        "Easy to grow in fertile, well-drained conditions, although not fully hardy; requires a sheltered, sunny position, in colder areas a south or west-facing wall would suit"
