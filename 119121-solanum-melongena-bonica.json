Start from seed or buy as small plants and grow on in a heated greenhouse or on a warm windowsill. Move to an unheated greenhouse or outside once all risk of frost has passed. Water regularly and feed every 10-14 days with a balanced liquid fertiliser, switching to a high potassium liquid feed once the first fruits have set. See Aubergines (Grow your own)",
