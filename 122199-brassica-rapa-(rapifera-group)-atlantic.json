See Vegetable CultivationSow seed outdoors in deep, fertile but firm, soil that isn't too acidic. If space is limited, start the seeds in modules or seedtrays and plant outside when big enough to handle easily (about 5 or 6 leaves). Watering through the summer months is very important.

It is very popular food for pigeons which only netting can prevent. It is also eaten by snails, although once plants are established, this damage isn't usually severe. The cabbage root fly can cause failure to thrive and a heavy infestation of mealy cabbage aphid can spoil the harvest",
