    "how_to_grow": {
        "cultivation": "Grow in an open bark-based orchid compost with addition of perlite, sphagnum moss or coir. Provide enough bright filtered light, but keep away from direct sunlight or a heating source. Ideal temperatures are around minimum 8\u00b0C at night and up to maximum 25 \u00b0C during day. Water regularly, when the pot feels light when lifted. Ensure that all water drains away, preventing the plant sitting wet. Orchid fertiliser can be applied regularly throughout the growing season. Reduce watering and feeding in winter months. For more notes on cultivation, see oncidium orchid (cool) cultivation",
        "propagation": "Propagation by seed is only possible in a controlled laboratory environment. Mature plants may be divided when the plant overgrows its container. Each division should have at least 3 older pseudobulbs with a sufficient amount of stored energy and water, to support new growth and reduce stress after repotting.",

            "Conservatory and greenhouse"

        "pruning": "No pruning required. Cut off spent flower spikes.",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to mealybugs, aphids and scale insects.",
        "diseases": "Generally disease-free. Poor air movement may cause bacterial or fungal rots. Good hygiene practice and sterilising cutting tools prevent the spread of virus diseases."
