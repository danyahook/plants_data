Provide enough bright filtered light, but keep away from direct sunlight or a heating source. Ideal temperatures are around 15°C minimum at night and up to maximum 25 °C during day. Water regularly, when the pot feels light when lifted. Ensure that all water drains away, preventing the plant sitting wet. Orchid fertiliser can be applied regularly throughout the growing season. Reduce watering and feeding in winter months. The orchid will naturally produce aerial roots, growing outside of the pot. As with many orchids, they grow best when well-established and slightly pot-bound. Re-potting should be only done if the plant overgrows its container or before the potting mix starts to deteriorate - approximately once in 2-3 years.",
