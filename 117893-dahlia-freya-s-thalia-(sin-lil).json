        "cultivation": "Grow in fertile, humus-rich, well-drained soil, enriched with organic matter and general purpose fertiliser, in full sun.

        "pests": "Aphids, leaf miners, glasshouse red spider mite and slugs are common pests. Earwigs sometimes damage blooms. Capsid bug and caterpillars are occasional pests",
        "diseases": "Powdery mildews can be damaging in dry conditions. In wet weather grey moulds and other fungal rots can be a problem. Fungal rots can also damage stored tubers. A virus may cause stunting, leaf markings and distortion"
