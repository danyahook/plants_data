As with many orchids, they grow best when the roots are slightly restricted. Therefore, avoid over-potting or frequent root disturbance. It is a warm-growing orchid and the temperatures should not drop below 16°C. It can be grown similarly to Moth Orchid (Phalaenopsis) but requires much brighter conditions. Provide indirect light and higher humidity by misting regularly in spring and summer, then move the plant to a bright, room in autumn and winter. Water approximately once per week, ensure that roots dry-out between the waterings, especially in winter. See indoor orchid cultivation",
