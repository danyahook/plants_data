Sow indoors in trays of free draining seed compost and lightly cover with vermiculite and place in a propagator at 20-25C until germination. Once germinated grow in cooler conditions, transplant when the seedlings have 2-3 true leaves, harden off for 7-10 days before planting in final position. See Vegetable Cultivation",
