Direct sow at a depth of 1cm with 30cm between rows, thin out later to 30cm between each plant when large enough to handle. Sow indoors in trays of free draining seed compost and lightly cover with vermiculite and place in a propagator at 20-25C until germination. Once germinated grow in cooler conditions, transplant when the seedlings have 2-3 true leaves, harden off for 7-10 days before planting in final position. See Vegetable Cultivation",
