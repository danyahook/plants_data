Plants can be grown outdoors in summer and brought into a cool greenhouse in early September. Blooms are produced in October to November, extending into December and so need protection from frosts in a temperate or warm greenhouse. They are grown either as disbudded or non-disbudded forms. Disbuds have all of the flower buds on each shoot removed except for the terminal bud so causing a much larger bloom to be produced than is usual. Up to 6 shoots are allowed to develop per plant, each bearing a single flower. Non-disbudded chrysanthemums are permitted to develop freely, with up to 6 stems per plant, each bearing 5 or more flower heads. The central bud of each spray is removed to give a more rounded outline",
