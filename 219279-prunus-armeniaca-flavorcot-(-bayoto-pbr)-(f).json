        "cultivation": "Apricots flourish on deep, moisture-retentive, well-drained, ideally slightly alkaline soils and struggle in poor, shallow soils. Although fully hardy, they bloom early, and the flowers are vulnerable to frost, so trees need a warm, sheltered position. Protect blossom from frost at night, and hand pollinate if insects are scarce. See apricot cultivation. Thin heavy crops when the size of hazelnuts. See fruit thinning",
        "propagation": "Propagate by grafting. Seed-raised plants are likely to be inferior to the parent",

            "Wall side borders"
        ],
        "pruning": "May be trained as a fan on a warm wall, or as a free-standing bush in milder areas. Prune only in spring, as the sap is rising, or between the end of July and the end of August",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to glasshouse red spider mite. Birds and squirrels may damage fruit",
        "diseases": "May be susceptible to silver leaf, bacterial canker, blossom wilt and brown rot. Not usually affected by peach leaf curl"
