Pinch out the growing tip when the plants are 15-20cm tall to encourage free-flowering, bushy plants. Staking and deadheading are not normally required. Plants should survive outdoors in most areas especially if protected by a thick mulch. In very cold areas lift the crowns and store in a greenhouse, raising fresh plants from these each year",
