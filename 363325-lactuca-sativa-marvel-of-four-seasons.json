Water when the soil is dry, ideally early in the morning. Harvest May to December if winter is mild. See lettuce cultivation for more information.",
        "propagation": "Propagate by seed. While it can be sown nearly all year round best results are to sow February to March under cover, March to May without cover and September, avoiding the hotter drier months. Grow in full sun on moisture-retentive soil. Sow a short row every fortnight to ensure continuity of cropping. Use cloches, plastic tunnels or horticultural fleece to protect early and late crops. When sowing in summer, bear in mind that high soil temperatures can prevent some cultivars from germinating. So in hot spells, sow in the evening, water with cold water and provide some shade to keep temperatures down. You can also grow lettuces in containers and growing bags, but be sure to water regularly. See lettuce cultivation for more information.",
