        "pruning": "Prune regularly depending on how the tree is trained – see pruning plums. Train fan-trained trees in spring. Pruning established fans is carried out in early summer and after harvest",
        "pests": "May be susceptible to plum aphid, red spider mite and winter moth caterpillar. The fruit can be damaged by plum moth caterpillars, wasps and birds",
        "diseases": "May be susceptible to silver leaf, bacterial canker and blossom wilt. The fruit can be affected by brown rot. Protect flowers against late frost damage"
