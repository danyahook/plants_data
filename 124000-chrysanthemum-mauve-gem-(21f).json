    "how_to_grow": {
        "cultivation": "Grow in a sheltered site in full sun in fertile, well-drained soil enriched with organic matter and general-purpose fertiliser. Water freely in dry weather. Pinch out the growing tip when the plants are 15-20cm tall to encourage free-flowering, bushy plants. Staking and deadheading are not usually required. Plants should survive outdoors in milder areas especially if protected by a thick mulch. In cold areas lift the crowns and store in a greenhouse, raising fresh plants from these each year",

        "diseases": "Chrysanthemum white rust can be very damaging and hard to control. Powdery mildews can be damaging in dry conditions. In wet weather grey moulds and other fungal rots can be severe. A virus may cause stunting and leaf markings"
