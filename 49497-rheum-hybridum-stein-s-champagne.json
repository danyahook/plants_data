Crowns (\"\"sets\"\") can be cropped for ten or more years, though division may be necessary after about five years. Plant crowns in November or December and up to the beginning of March if necessary. A spring mulch of well-rotted organic matter 7cm (2 1/2in) deep will help to retain moisture but do not bury the crowns. Plants will also respond to watering during prolonged dry periods in summer. Apply a general fertiliser such as growmore in spring or summer at 70g per sq m (2oz per square yard)",
