Water moderately in growth and apply a balanced liquid feed 2-3 times during the growing season; variegated plants revert to green if overfed. Outdoors grow in moist but well-drained, fertile, sandy loam with added leaf mould, in a sheltered site with full or partial shade. See houseplants advice profile for further information",
