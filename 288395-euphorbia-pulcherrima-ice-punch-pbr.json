Minimum temperature of 13-15\u00b0C during the flowering season. Flowering and bract colouring is initiated by short winter day-length, occurring naturally in December and January; from November onwards, plants should be put in a dark room after twelve hours of daylight and protected from artificial light sources. Water sparingly during growth and apply a balanced liquid fertiliser every 10-14 days. See Poinsettia cultivation.",
