In very cold areas lift the crowns and store in a greenhouse, raising fresh plants from these each year. See chrysanthemum cultivation",

        "pruning": "Pinch out the growing tip when the plants are 15-20cm tall to encourage free-flowering, bushy plants. Cut back to near ground level in the autumn",
        "pests": "Aphids and leaf miners are common pests. Leaf and bud eelworms can damage stock that has not been heat-treated. Earwigs sometimes damage blooms. Capsid bug and glasshouse red spider mite are occasional pests",
        "diseases": "Chrysanthemum white rust, can be very damaging and hard to control. Powdery mildews can be damaging in dry conditions. In wet weather grey moulds and other fungal rots can be severe. A virus may cause stunting and leaf markings"
