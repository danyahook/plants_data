The plant may be placed outside during the summer in a sheltered and partially-shaded spot. It requires a moist but well-drained, humus-rich soil; in hot, dry summers water the stem as well as the soil, but avoid watering the crown in winter. Apply liquid fertiliser monthly during the growing season. Will grow without winter protection only in milder areas",
