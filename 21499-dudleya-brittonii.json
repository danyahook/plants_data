A position in full or slightly filtered light is preferred at all times. During active growth, water moderately and apply a low-nitrogen fertiliser once a month from March to the beginning of May and from late August to October, but cease feeding in the summer dormancy period, when water should be withheld. Feeding in the winter in UK under glass is not required owing to low daylight levels and similarly, watering should also be reduced",

        "pests": "Under glass may be subject to mealybugs",
